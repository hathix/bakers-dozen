Weather:

	Rain:			All attacks weakened	
	Snow:			Everyone slowed
	Overcast:		
	Storm:			Everyone takes damage every turn
	Night:			
	

Nullifies Atk/Def EVs temp. (helps screw over overly-specialized people, increases versatility/reversal)
No (positive) stat changes
Reduces FoW revealing radius (i.e. harder to see.)
All turn-lasting effects last longer (there's a percent of them gaining a turnLeft after each turn)
All probabilities increased (in pushLuck) - so secondary effects more often, things more accurate
2ndary effects happen more often (like increasing probs) - but it's discrim against people w/o special effect abilities
Boosts stats of weaker animals (good for comebacks)
Randomly adds fog to field?

Terrain effects:
	Sun: 			mud>dirt, ice>water-shallow, snow>dirt, swamp>grass?
	Rain:			dirt>mud, path>mud, snow>water-shallow, sand>mud
	Snow:			grass*>snow, water>ice, dirt>snow	
	Overcast:		?
	Storm:			?
	Night:			?
	
	* means some will turn. ? means i'm considering it.


TODO
Add tag to affliction: selfInflicted. If so, weather that cancels afflictions won't do anything.



Weather turns on and off every few turns (when there's NO weather, there's a random chance of a new weather starting)
Animals have preferred weather. They all get tiny stat boost (+5%) in that weather.
If you're in preferred weather, weather harm (all save sun) won't affect you


FOG OF WAR
Add to Team obj. They have [Coords] where there's fog
When a team (human, not enemy) comes up, black out anything that is in the fog zone
When person moves (even along path), defog anything within 2 spaces
Add ability to defog large range
Have some event fire each time animal steps (onStep)

Allow bigger teams (to allow for more scouting)


New battle mode; donut collector
Animal gathers donuts as they walk over. When they die the donuts scatter
Goal: control most donuts at end of 10/20 turns
