On creating a level:
	Supply the compressed version of the tiles. This is the format:
		['background',[actors],[flags]]
	Although you can omit the array around the [actors] if there's just one actor. You can omit [actors] or [flags] altogether.
	Examples:
		['g',new Obstacle()]
		['g',[new Obstacle(), new Steppable()],['wet','watery']]
	Regarding actors:
		The things at the end of the list are put in front (top of the list) so they'll show up on top. Things at start of list on bottom.


Writing abilities:
	If you hijack a function, put custom code @ top and write:
		self.super("funcName",arg1,arg2,arg3) where args are what you initially accepted and funcName is the function name
	At the bottom.
